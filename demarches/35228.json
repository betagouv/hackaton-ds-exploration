  "description": "This service is provided by the <strong>International Students & Scholars Office (ISSO) of Université Grenoble Alpes</strong> to all students, PhD students, researchers and their families studying or working at one of our partner institutions <strong>in Grenoble</strong>. \r\n\r\n<h1>Please note</h1>\r\n<hr>\r\nI.<strong> You cannot submit a residence permit application directly through this form.</strong> It is only intended for the verification of your application file by ISSO before your online application (student residence permits) or prior to your appointment at the on-campus Isère Préfecture office.\r\n<br>\r\nII. The validation of your file by ISSO doesn't guarantee its acceptance by the Isère Préfecture. \r\n<br>\r\nIII. ISSO will only check the main documents of your file. Please refer to the complete list of required documents, available either on the national online application system (for students) or on the UGA international website.\r\n<br>\r\n<hr>\r\nDue to the Covid-19 pandemic, ISSO will only check application files submitted through this online form.\r\n\r\nOnce you complete the form, ISSO will give you a feedback within a week (on average).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<em>The information you provide in filling out this questionnaire will be saved electronically only for the time needed to review your documents, and will be treated as strictly confidential.\r\nOnly staff members from UGA department of International Affairs (DGD DIT) will be able to access your documents. No information will be communicated to anyone outside of the university.\r\nIf you wish to exercise your rights within the framework of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, you can make a request by contacting: isso@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr.\r\n</em>",
